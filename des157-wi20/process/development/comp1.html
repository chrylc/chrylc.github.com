    <h1>Project Comp 1</h1>
    <img src="images/project-comp.jpg">
    <p>For my interactive project, I wanted mobile accessibility, hence, creating my design comp with mobile settings. I also clearly labeled the pages and how many HTML files I will be using. Design wise, I chose a calm font with a dusty color palette that reflects the mood of the app. I also spaced things out so that the user has maximun readibility and room to make choices. I wanted to emphasize this project's accessibility and customizability so there are two whole pages that allow the user to explore their options. In the breathing section of the app, there will be bars that appear each second represents the seconds for each part of the breathing exercise.</p>
