    <h1>Project Comp 2</h1>
    <img src="images/comp2.jpg">
    <p>For my comp 2, I adjusted the interface so that the background was lighter so that I could add new colors to the breathing exercise theme without the background contrasting it too much. I also realize that the dropdown options are not as nice with mobile adaptation so I changed them to box options and sliders. These changes make the interface mobile friendly and easy to navigate.</p>
