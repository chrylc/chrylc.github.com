    <h1>Final Project Academic Research</h1>
    <p>My original topic was focused around ADHD and creating an application that could help children and adults with learning disorders with a fidgeting app. Upon further research I found a commonality among people whether they have a learning disorder or not. According to the Learning Disabilities Association of America, individuals struggling with ADHD have a significantly higher risk of developing mental health issues, especially anxiety and depression. </p>
    <p>Anxiety is something that a huge population experiences as well. In fact, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness with over 40 million people affected annually. These facts, also with having recently experienced anxiety myself, I decided to alter my focus.</p>
    <p>I wanted to create a screen based project that will help people suffering from anxiety disorders and other mental illnesses and I came into this new topic with several ideas but I wanted to find an idea that can be backed through research. </p>
    <p>I keyworded “anxiety” and looked up videos. One video that caught my attention was a TedTalk on how to cope with anxiety. In this video, I learned that in order to overcome anxiety, you must be in a healthy headspace. She really emphasized taking control of your own life. This includes “doing things badly.” When you approach a task and not care about the result, you’re taking the anxiety out and replacing it with excitement. Other topics in this video include forgiving yourself and finding meaning in life. Although these are helpful tips, these are all things that an individual has to come to terms with themselves. So I asked myself: How do I create a project that will prompt users to think positively and healthier?</p>
    <p>I started to look up self treatments for anxiety and the most recommended advice I discovered was breathing exercises, yoga, meditation, and other forms of introspective deep thinking. Deep breathing sparked my interest as it’s a practice that not only helps calm anxiety but has a plethora of other health benefits as well.</p>
    <p>This allowed me to take my project in a new direction. Deep breathing has so many benefits so why isn't this something we do all the time? I wanted to make an app that promotes a healthy mindset whether the user has anxiety or not. Having a positive headspace is an important aspect when striving to be more inclusive, respectful, and mindful.</p>
